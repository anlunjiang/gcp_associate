DOCKET and KUBERNETES

docker history image - can vw all layers if a image - described in DockerFiles


docker compose can define and run multi container apps in YAMP
* start stop services
* setup ports
* expose API to host 
etc
Uusally a yaml file like:

version: "3" 
services:
    api:
        image:
        ports:
            - "5000:5000"
        depends_on:
            - db
        environment:
             DATABASE_URL=
    db:
        image:
        etc

Running this will spin up all the docker containers from the specified images

KUBERNETES (kube, k8s)

(docker) container orchestration at scale

framework to run dist systems resiliently handling scaling, failover and provides deploy patterns

Nodes  -server
nodes run pods, same ip and network and nodes, considered stateless, not affecting the main container


all pods share storage space - but you canuse a volume mount to connect pods in different containers
