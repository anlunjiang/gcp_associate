# Deploying Wordpress with Cloud Launcher

## Wordpress
A Web publishing platform for building blogs and websites

To install an instance of wordpress, you can use cloud launcher - which is good for launching all sorts of applications such as wordpress or jenkins 
* Click on Marketplace on the GCP console page
* Select wordpress and you can then launch it from the console 
    * Set name and zone and admin email
    * Set machine type and disk

NOTE: that marketplace uses deployment manager behind the scenes

You can then do the same for jenkins
