# Creating a Streaming Data Pipeline for a Real-Time Dashboard with Dataflow

`bq mk taxirides` - big query create database

You can open data studio and look it will show thelatest data every time you refresh

You can add a big query sql to the dashboard and iti will show that each time - you can then perform visualisations on top of that

stopping data flow - can cancel or drain (wait for the jobs to finish procesing)
